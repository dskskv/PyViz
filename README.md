# Experiments with Visualization Libraries in Python

`Python` has a number of visualization libraries. My goals are the following:

- Learn/Experiment with the different visualization libraries
- Understand strengths and weaknesses of these libraries
- Test them out on different datasets/problems

Some of the visualization libraries I am considering are:

1. `Seaborn`
2. `Bokeh`
3. `Mayavi`
4. `Holoviews`
5. `Datashader`
6. `Altair`
7. `Matplotlib` - specific focus on 3-D
